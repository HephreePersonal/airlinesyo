# Flight Management Application Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the detailed plan for implementing basic flight management functionality in a PHP/MySQL web application.

## Application Structure

### Pages and Functionalities
- **Home Page (`index.php`)**
  - Navigation links to manage flights (add, view, edit, delete).

- **Add Flight (`add_flight.php`)**
  - Form to input flight details (already partially implemented).
  - Validation and error handling.

- **View Flights (`view_flights.php`)**
  - Display all flights in a table format.
  - Each flight entry includes options to edit or delete.

- **Edit Flight (`edit_flight.php`)**
  - Form pre-filled with existing flight details.
  - Allows updating flight information.

- **Delete Flight**
  - Option within the view flights page.
  - Confirmation prompt before deletion.

## Backend Enhancements
- **FlightRepository Class**
  - Add methods for:
    - Retrieving all flights (`getAllFlights()`).
    - Retrieving a single flight by ID (`getFlightById($id)`).
    - Updating flight details (`updateFlight($id, $data)`).
    - Deleting a flight (`deleteFlight($id)`).

## Database Schema
- Current schema is sufficient for basic flight management. No immediate changes required.

## Technical Implementation Steps
1. **Enhance FlightRepository**
   - Implement methods for fetching, updating, and deleting flights.

2. **Develop Frontend Pages**
   - Create `view_flights.php` to list flights.
   - Create `edit_flight.php` for editing flights.
   - Add delete functionality with confirmation.

3. **Update Navigation**
   - Modify `index.php` to include navigation links to these pages.

4. **Testing and Validation**
   - Ensure all CRUD operations work correctly.
   - Validate form inputs and handle errors gracefully.
